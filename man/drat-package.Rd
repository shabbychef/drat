  Easy-to-use package repository creation and access
}
\description{
  The drat package permits user to create and use ad-hoc package
  repositories. It takes advantage of GitHub accounts and
  \sQuote{gh-pages} branches which automatically become web-accessible
  and can be used to provide a repository.  Alternatively, custom
  repository paths and addresses can be used.
  
}
\details{
  Given a user account on GitHub, say, \sQuote{eddelbuettel}, and a repository
  \sQuote{drat}, we can infer an top-level repostory URL as such as
  \url{http://eddelbuettel.github.io/drat} by supplying only the username (as
  the rest is inferred by defaults).  This allows us to create easily
  useable, identifiable and shareable per-user repositories---without
  the user having to create and administer a webserver anywhere.

  Two higher level functions then allow both insertion of source package
  in the common compressed \sQuote{tar.gz} format, as well as addition
  of a given drat repository to an R session so that package in the
  repository can be accesses.
